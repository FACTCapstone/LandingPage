<p>     The Updated Farm Directory is a hub for farmers to promote their farms, and for customers to search for the farms that best suit their needs. To do this, we’ve built and hosted a website and database that allows farmers the ability to create an account and save their farms information for the following categories: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Products</li>
  <li>Specialty Items</li>
  <li>Ways To Purchase</li>
  <li>Purchase Locations</li>
  <li>Farm Certifications</li>
</ul>

<p>     Users then have the ability to use those tags to search the database on the main landing page. To help curate the results to a specific user’s area, we have them filter the results by a specific US state. </p>
