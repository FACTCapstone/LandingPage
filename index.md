<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
<div>
  <p>&emsp; The Updated Farm Directory is a hub for farmers to promote their farms, and for customers to search for the farms that best suit their needs. To do this, we’ve built and hosted a website and database that allows farmers the ability to create an account and save their farms information for the following categories: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Products</li>
    <li>Specialty Items</li>
    <li>Ways To Purchase</li>
    <li>Purchase Locations</li>
    <li>Farm Certifications</li>
  </ul>

  <p>&emsp; Users then have the ability to use those tags to search the database on the main landing page. To help curate the results to a specific user’s area, we have them filter the results by a specific US state. </p>

  <p>&emsp; Farmers now have the ability to reach out to more potential customers within their region, while customers have the opportunity to get in contact and purchase farm products from certified farms that practice humane farming techniques.</p>

<h2>What Makes Us Unique?</h2>
<div>
  <p>&emsp; Our project offers a number of different features that help both our client and users. We offer a simplified UI interface so users can easily navigate through the website and perform searches, while farmers can easily create, update and maintain their farm’s information. We also have generate a map with every search, so that way users can see the provided address of each farm to see which one is closest to them.</p>
